## List of Plugins
To see a list of plugins send `/help` to your bot or list files in `bin/plugins` directory

Currently I have made these plugins:
* `/os` - Send to me my OS information
* `/weather <city>` - Send to me my city's weather informations
* `/pokemon <name>` - Send to me informations about <name> pok√©mon
* `/expand <url>` - Expand a short url
* `/btc <currency>` - Show quotation of Bitcoin in <currency>

## Add a Plugin
* To add a simple plugin you have to add `name.js` file to a `bin/plugins` directory.
* Follow the examples to make your own plugin.
* Add your plugin command and description to a `list.json` file

That's all.

To use it send to your bot `/name`.
